Life as We Know It;100000005;Review: As everyone knows any Apple product is outstanding and superior to the rest. Its superb. fast and amazing.I recommend buying the AirCase MacBook sleeve ( black and green ) and the MOCA smooth touch battle hard shell skin cover ( grey colour ). Both these products are on amazon.in. both VERY GOOD and must buy products to help improve your MacBook Air experience. ( I do not advertise or sell these products btw)
License to Wed;100000006;Review: The product is what it is and there is nothing to review about its capabilities. I wanted a MacBook and after looking at multiple outlets for prices amazon had the best pricing for this product. (With offers combined).I ordered the product on prime and there was a deficit on stock and by that delayed my delivery by a couple of days. Other than that the product was as expected. Delivery was smooth and as expected. The retailer is Appario retail and to my knowledge is an amazon subsidiary.
